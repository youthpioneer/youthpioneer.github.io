1228下午，据被监禁的邱占萱同学传出消息：北大副校长陈宝剑来到抗议现场，一声令下，转身就走。就是这个清场命令，使得同学们遭受了18个小时的监禁！

该校长此前给同学们做出承诺：会兑现王仰麟校长的承诺，不再阻挠学工接触，支持工友之家的活动，支持元旦的工友晚会，为工友之家的活动安排场地！然而却出尔反尔，继续派保安头子冲击工友活动现场，开除工友来进行报复！毫无诚信可言！

同学们在被清场和监禁时，强权官僚的丑恶面目暴露无遗，他们仗着人多势众，同学们势单力薄，对同学们暴力相向，欺负虐待！

几名保安拖拽薛同学不动，领导一句大喊，“放倒！”薛同学随即倒在一旁的单车上，全身一片疼痛。一根耳机线顺势缠到了脖子上，他们竟然还想用这跟线把同学拖走！在被抬着的过程中，他的后脑勺重重地磕在台阶上，身体突然严重不适，要求去看医生，根本无人回应！

一名女同学在被拖拽过程中奋力反抗，被保安员几次抓住手，有意掀起衣服盖在她头上，露出肚子，被完全遮挡住了视线！她感到无比屈辱，质问老师为什么脱掉她的衣服，老师竟然说：“谁要脱掉你的衣服，是你自己！”该名老师还曾趁着他人不注意，偷偷地疯狂踹同学们解恨。

一名男同学的裤子更是被直接扒掉，只剩下一件内裤！倒在地上后，被老师拉着羽绒服的帽子拖拽前行，几乎就要窒息了！恶势力的手段如此无耻，令人发指！

此情此景，竟发生在号称“思想自由，兼容并包”的北大！黑官僚在学校动用黑老师、黑保安、学生干部伤天害理，暴力殴打，非法监禁，肆无忌惮！而一切的幕后黑手正是陈宝剑！

其作为副校长，权力一手遮天，分管青年研究中心，保卫部，后勤部等，分别是公认的删帖维稳基地和违反劳动法的沦陷区。保卫部在其手中，打击报复参加活动的工友，跟踪监视同学，暴力清场等等，办下了一系列龌龊与非法的事！

“窗外寒风凛冽，室内暖意融融”。原北大马会同学在楼下被暴力殴打，北大马院执行院长孙熙国却在同一栋楼的教室里办起了“鹿会”的活动，开的不亦乐乎，还说什么：人最大的痛苦就是说一些自己都不相信的话！孙熙国和马院提交改组的申请，未经任何一个马会成员的参与，马会就被强制改组！改组后的马会团支书王昱博，作为团委干部，曾经多次偷拍马会同学的活动，闯入教室公然干扰，阻挠活动的正常进行！

黄钟毁弃，瓦釜雷鸣！我们可以看出，孙熙国举办的第一次读书活动究竟是什么货色？去研究理学，去学习孔孟之道——“用今天的话说，代表了一种三观的统一。其中，价值观核心是‘应该’，我们应该过什么样的生活，我们应该成为什么样的人，我们应该做什么，我们应该怎么做。”孙难道以为披上了马会的外衣，就能掩盖粗鄙的马克思主义水平么？

现在，同学的诉求依然没有达成，马会依然被改组，斗争仍未停止。反对校园暴力，反对改组，还我马会，还我工友之家，撤销处分！校长陈宝剑，打压马会的急先锋；院长孙熙国，改组马会的带头人。二人和官僚机构一同，促成了马会的被强制改组，被暴力清场！打压进步青年，压制新生力量，妄图开历史的倒车，终将成为历史的罪人！

On the afternoon of December 28, Qiu Zhanxuan who was detained by the authorities sent the message that it was the vice president of PKU, Chen Baojian, that ordered to stop the protests. The students have been detained for 18 hours.


The vice president had garenteed that he would not obstruct the communication between students and workers, support the activity of the Home of Workers (which is organized by students and workers), and support the workers' New year party. However, he continued to demand the public security to obstruct the activity of the Home of Workers and fire workers.


The bureaucracy used various violent methods to stop the protests. A male student was dragged by several security guards and fell on a bike. A headphone cord was wrapped around his neck and they even tried to used the line to drag him away! The back of his head was heavily slammed on the steps and he felt severely uncomfortable. When he asked for medical help, no one responded at all!


A female student struggled when being dragged by the security. The security guard grabbed her hand , took off her clothes and covered her face. She felt extremely humiliated and questioned why they took off her clothes. A university staff said, "Nobody wants to remove your clothes! It's yourself!" People have seen the staff kicking students madly.


A male student's pants was took off, leaving only underwear. The university staff dragged him away by the down jacket hat and almost suffocate him. Those gangs are so shameless and horrifying!


The terrifying scene happened in the so-called "free and inclusive" PKU. University bureaucrats have used university staff, security guards and student cadres to beat and kidnap students. Chen Baojian, the vice president of PKU who directed the brutal crackdown, is in charged of security department and logistics department. The logistics department controlled all university workers and is known for severe violation of labour laws. The security department has retaliated against progressive workers, stalked and monitored students and execute violent crackdown on student protests. He have tried all kinds of filthy and illegal ways!


When Marxist students were beaten outside in cold weather, Sun Xiguo, the dean of School of Marxism of Peking University, is leading an seminar of new "Marxist Society" in the same building. "One's biggest pain is to say something he don't believe himself." he said. Sun and the School of Marxism filed the application of reconstruction of the Marxist Society without consent of any member of Marxist Society. The new leader of "Marxist Society" Wang Yibo is a Youth League Committee leader. He used to secretly tape and openly obstruct Marxist Society's activities.


What is Sun's seminar of new "Marxist Society" for? The seminar is about studying Neo-Confucianism. "In today's words, it represents a unity of three views！ Among them, the core of values is "should", what kind of life should we live, what kind of people we should be, what we should do, how should we do?" Sun thought a "Marxist Society" title would cover his vulgar marxism?
