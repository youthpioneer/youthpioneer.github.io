12月28日下午两点左右，十三名来自北大马会的同学们来到北京大学马克思主义学院所在的理科五号楼楼下，抗议马院对马克思主义学会的强行无理改组。此后的十六个小时里，**这十三名同学被围堵、遭数人搬抬、限制在教室中不得自由，还遭到父母与老师的殴打。**

事情起因于12月27日，北大马会的指导老师孙熙国与指导单位马院团委发起了对马克思主义学会的强行改组决议，并在半天内得到通过。**参与改组筹备会议讨论的32名改组发起人无一参加过马克思主义学会的活动，尤为可笑的是，新任马会团支书王昱博，曾多次强行闯入马会同学所在自习室，甚至曾在楼道里搬来椅子透过门窗偷拍马会会员。**

此决议未经马会同学的任何表决，却在短短时间内得到通过并且公开发布，当即引起全体马会同学的强烈反感，数十人联名抗议，要求撤销改组，但未得到校方同意。**12月28日上午，马会会长邱占萱和社团其他成员一同前去马院团委处反映意见，提出诉求，对方不接受讨论，推诿敷衍，态度强硬。**

迫于无奈，28日下午两点，十三名马会同学来到理科五号楼楼下，高举纸牌要求撤销改组、停止打压马会，进行沉默抗议。纸牌上书“**坚决抗议改组北大马会**”“**立即撤销改组决定**”“**32名改组成员 无一马会成员**”’“**要工农之马会 不要官僚之马会**”。几分钟内，就有保安前来试图驱散，并遮拦路人手机不许拍照。很快，二十名左右保安到达现场，迅速把学生们包围住，几个保卫部领导开始跳起抢夺标语。

**标语被夺走后，沉默抗议再也无法进行，马会学生只好喊出口号：“抗议改组北大马会”“还我北大马会”“还我工友之家”“工学结合无罪”等诉求。这时保安们围成人墙，用手肘推搡、用膝盖顶撞、倾身压上同学们，僵持许久。**几个保卫部领导，直接将手挽手的同学们强行冲击分扯开。十三名同学被分成了两部分，落单的孙嘉言、王瀚枢和薛子威同学各自被多人架起手臂和腿脚，抬进了楼内。同时，一名在周围拍照的同学手机被四、五人配合抢走，在争执过程中，被人背后锁喉，大衣口袋被撕烂，一度被推倒在地，拽进楼内，十几分钟后才逃离出来。

剩余的十名同学在对方强压之下，为了保护自己蹲坐在了地上。保卫部人马立即围成圈避免被路过同学看见，有时皮鞋还会踢到学生们的身上。在这个过程中，各个院系的辅导员、团委甚至党委老师纷纷到场，“善意”地询问马会同学的诉求，马会同学具体回答了数次，他们也装作没有听到，继续不断地询问同学们的诉求。同学们期盼交流沟通，而一众团学领导们却只顾忙于打哈哈，不断在寒风中消耗同学们的体力。被搪塞推诿过多次的马会同学们，于是提出希望马院团委副书记李石生，和做出过承诺解决问题的副校长陈宝剑能够出面，沟通解决问题，而不是像围在周围的团学老师一样，对于同学们的心声充耳不闻，只想着如何把同学们骗进理科五号楼去，美其名曰“怕学生们冻着”。

辅导员们反复说地上寒冷，不要着凉受冻，但马会同学不正是被暴力推搡逼坐在地上的吗？**一个女生被保卫部女老师抬起双脚，争执之中被脱掉了鞋，在寒风中只穿着一层薄薄的袜子。几个同学的眼镜手机等被打落或者抢走，而当同学们要求被架进楼里的三名同学不被限制、自由离开时，在场老师宣称：“他们在会议室里等你们呢。”**

在周围老师领导保证不动用暴力的情况下，十名同学两度起立，但是立刻就被保安围堵推搡，保卫部领导趁同学们刚刚站起，高喊，“**后面再来一队人!**”加大了与同学肢体对抗的人力投入。同学们才不得不在站起后又坐地保护安全。

僵持之际，陈宝剑副校长赶到现场，对同学们破口大骂后，下令把所有学生抬进会议室。一声令下，在场的五十多名团学老师和保卫部人员齐齐上阵，手脚并用把剩下十名同学生拉硬拽起来，学工老师最先动手，和保卫部人员密切配合，四五个人针对一个学生、抬起双手双脚暴力带入楼内控制，期间发生多次拖拽拉扯事件，不少同学被拖行数米远。

**由于缺少对头部的保护，邱占萱、薛子威等多位同学头部被严重磕碰，薛子威同学被急速抬行，身边保安员对讲机的耳机线缠绕在了他的脖子上，失去理智的团学领导老师们竟然试图通过耳机线拽着薛同学前行，混乱中他的后脑勺直接猛地撞在理科五号楼的台阶上了，当即头晕目眩，薛同学本就身体虚弱，要求去校医院检查，但在场领导们不闻不问。一位男同学在楼道里直接被拉着羽绒服的帽子拖行，几近窒息，有同学的羽绒服在拖拽过程中被撕烂!**

<p align="center">一位同学的衣服被撕扯烂</p>

**两位女同学的裤子险些被扯掉，一位男同学更是生生被拽掉了裤子，仅着一条内裤被扔在了冰冷的地面。一位女同学由于反抗激烈，外套和毛衣都被拉扯掉，贴身的保暖内衣裸露在外，极其屈辱！数名同学的手机、眼镜、甚至钱包都在这一过程中遗失或者被抢夺。**

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.loli.net/2018/12/30/5c28831373d6b.jpg"/></p>
<p align="center">一位女同学的羽绒服被扒掉之后，毛衣也被脱掉</p>

学校老师们从一开始就想要把十三名学生单独分隔开。两位同学从被清场之后就被分别带入一间教室和一处楼梯隔间，剩余的十一名学生因为互相帮带、挽手被统一扔进了理科五号楼133社工实验室。保卫部的几个老师堵在门口，禁止学生打开房间门，不同意让被隔离的同学与其他人一同汇合，并矢口否认这是限制人身自由：“你们不是要谈吗？学校老师一会儿就来找你们。”**在场的老师甚至口出恶言：“你们这些就是北大的败类！渣滓！”**

但在随后的一个多小时里，除了这几个保卫部的领导，就只有执勤的保安小哥陪在这间教室，没有任何可以解决问题的人出现。**借此机会，马会同学向保安们介绍了自己创办工友之家的初心和服务工人的愿望，并建议保卫部领导给予保安小哥休息的机会。**

到了五点多，保卫部按照指令在教室里外（绕楼一周）放置了**信号屏蔽器**，意图阻断同学们与外界的通讯自由，来掩饰自己的暴行。一个保卫部工作人员的对讲机里传出清晰的指令“**在教室里不许他们使用手机！**”这其实也是为了在受到隔离、分别关押的学生中间进行互相孤立，以便将他们“**各个击破**”。

为此他们想出一系列的计策。晚上八点左右，忍不住要上厕所的学生发出抗议，才争取到三名女学生一同去上厕所的机会。但是**张子依、张小玉、孙嘉言三位女同学上完厕所后，却再一次被老师强行夹带，被拖去了不同的教室看管。**丧失了作为通讯工具的手机，被隔离看守的同学们只能通过窗户隔空喊话。而室外早已有巡逻的保安进行了封锁，不许同学经过附近位置，通过窗口求救也变成了奢望，被关押的十几名学生就连报警都无法完成了。鉴于此，剩下的8名男同学再不敢单独出去上厕所，只好在监控下用杯子解决。

到了凌晨零点半，学校又组织了一次暴力清场，**三四十位老师冲入教室**，其中赫然有着在场同学张子尉的父母。借口要让张子尉和父母、学院老师单独交流，采取了暴力夹带的手段。在8名学生互挽手臂以防被拉扯开的情况下，**学校老师们分工起来有人掰开交叉的手臂，有人抓着学生的帽子往外扯，有人用腿拗开膝盖让人站立不稳，最终又把张子尉抬进了另一间房。**其他的几个同学也陆续被以同样的方式分离开。

据几位现场同学回忆，校团委书记王逸鸣指着同学鼻子破口大骂，“你们这些败类……我不是团委书记！我在别人面前要形象，在你们面前不要形象，你们把我的形象都毁了！”团委团体部副部长田定方老师，边说“我不是团体部的！”，边对王世伟同学上手殴打。王同学被打倒在地后，化院党委副书记王飞蹲下来说，“你怎么躺在这儿啊。”

“基础医学院党委副书记郭琦，上来就辱骂我们，对我们进行人身攻击，说我们没人性，我们不配做人，更不配做北大的学生，不守诚信，没有底线，吃着北大的干败坏北大的事，说我们只为自己考虑，一群败类……有些话说得特别难听，从此开始，在场的各个院的学工老师，党委书记副书记，保卫部老师，校团委书记王逸鸣，还有团体部的田定方都轮番对我们的同学展开了人身攻击，**不停地骂出脏话，到最后我们被骂的都麻木了，因为对方人实在太多，骂的话非常难听，渣滓，垃圾，没人性等等难以想象地从北大老师的嘴里连珠炮似的冒了出来，而且重复了不止一遍，当时整个人感觉价值观完全崩塌，内心异常崩溃。”**

一旦同学们被分离开，各院的老师就开始以各种荒唐的面目来打击学生。

**药学院辅导员兼团委书记徐国旺老师在深夜与孙嘉言同学交谈了数小时，劝她说：“在马会里混能有什么前途啊？你看他们连牌子都不让你举！跟着我干才有光明的前途，我可以任命你为学院团委的副部长。你可以好好考虑几天，但考虑的前提是不能拒绝，你不同意我也可以在网上发任命公告。我希望以后每两天可以跟你交流一次思想和业务，每次十到三十分钟，你不来找我的话我就去教室、去宿舍找你（徐是男老师，孙是女同学），反正我脸皮够厚。”他甚至还扬言，“我不仅可以把你扛回北大医学部，还可以把你扛到我家！”这和性骚扰有何异？他还向另一个房间里的同学谎称孙嘉言已经答应了他的要求，试图用谎言和挑拨分化、使学生们屈服。

学校老师的百般骚扰不管用，就自然想到了利用父母来对学生施压。**张子尉的父亲连扇他五个耳光，扯着他的帽子、揪住头发要带他回家!围观的老师拍手叫好，说“这种不孝子就是该打！”**张子尉拒不接受这种安排，他就只好当面向基础医学院党委副书记郭琦提出：“我委托你把张子尉休学。”郭琦毫不在意张子尉的连声反对，直接点头答应。张子尉母亲在一旁嚎啕大哭，试图阻拦老师和其父亲的行动，但是无济于事，家庭关系分崩离析。

另一位在场同学张小玉的父母、姐姐、姐夫连夜赶来北京找她，她的母亲把她按在地上，**揪着头发拖行不允许她继续参与，脚蹬高跟鞋对着张小玉小腿用力踢踹数次，导致张同学小腿浮肿，老师们则对此视而不见，反而责怪张小玉“让父母伤心了”！**

**这期间，陈宝剑副校长始终没有出面谈话。**很多同学几乎在这一夜里没怎么合眼，被频繁地叫醒谈话，被频繁地“教育训话”！有的同学整整一晚睡了不到一小时！期间，不断有学工老师、院系领导前来给同学们施压，表示将严厉处分同学们，甚至有警察前来做笔录，对同学破口大骂，“给脸不要脸！”“流氓！”。有的同学一次次地想要和其他同学会合，又一次次地被堵在门口、或者在地面被暴力拖行回房间，很多同学的身上淤青红肿，不敢稍使力气，身体也因为持续的熬夜而变得虚弱。

而当这一切闹剧结束时，就已经是早上六点五十多了，学工老师们甚至还要在最后一道程序上耗费时间。为了所有人能够一同离开、不会有人无端被卡，几名同学几乎说破了嘴皮，但是老师们仍然回避问题，还抱怨同学不自动离开是在给其他同学造成伤害。最终，在同学们的坚持之下，大家才勉强重新会合起来，手挽着手，离开了理科五号楼这北大校园内的魔窟。

12月28日至12月29日，对于十几位北大同学来说，是黑暗的16个小时。

**这16个小时里，往日温和斯文的团委、学工、党委领导们，也在这期间斯文扫地，对同学极尽恶毒之语，时而人身攻击，动辄“无情无义”“人渣败类”之语；时而温情脉脉，送水送饭，极尽讨好，与之前判若两人；时而“我们就图个升官发财，还等着立功呢”，时而“我们这样都是为了你们好！”；时而威逼利诱，以学生干部职位相诱惑、以约谈进宿舍的名义相威胁……让人一改对于北大团学领导的认识，不怪乎有同学说自己，“感觉价值观完全崩塌，内心异常崩溃。”**

**这16小时期间，这些信仰马克思主义的中国青年，在自己的国土上被狠狠“教育”了一番，被殴打、被拖拽、被扒衣裤、被言语侮辱、被威逼利诱，甚至连自己的父母也要在团学领导挑拨下连扇自己耳光、狂踹自己小腿！**

即便如此，这些青年仍然苦苦坚守了十几个小时，苦苦地要求与同志们携手共战。即使面容憔悴，衣着破碎，也要以坚定不屈的姿态并肩离开那幢罪恶的理科五号楼，继续大踏步迈向新的征程，正如同学们所言，“自27号改组通知之后，真假马会之争便没有停过，我们倒要看看，大学校园内要工农之马会，还是官僚之马会！”


### 英文版：
At about 2 o’clock in the afternoon of December 28,13 students from the Beijing University Marxist Society came to the fifth building of science department where the Marxist School of Beijing University downstairs. For the next 16 hours,these 13 students were surrounded and moved by some people. They were trapped in the classroom,and beaten by teachers and parents.

That incident began on December27,when Sun XiGuo,the steering teacher of Beijing University Marxist Society,and the leading unit launched a forced decision of Marxist Society,Oder them to change the organization,which was passed in half day.None of the 32 people who joined in the preparatory meeting for reorganization had participated in the activities of Marxist Society. What’s more ridiculous is,Wang YuBo,the new League Secretary of Marxist Society,has repeatedly broke into the study room belongs to Marxist Society. They even moved chairs though windows and doors to took photos by stealth in the corridor.

This decision which was passed and published in a short time without voted by the Marxist Society students. It immediately aroused the strong aversion of all the Marxist Society students, and dozens of students jointly protested to against the cancellation of reorganization. On the morning of December 28, Marxist Society’s President Qiu Zhanxuan and other members of the association went to the Marxist School Central Committee to reflect their opinions and raise their requests. The other side refused to discuss，and make some prevarications. Their attitude is very bad.

Forced to do so, at 2: 00 p.m. on the 28th, 13  Marxist Society students came to the downstairs of the fifth floor of the Science Section and raised cards to demand that the reorganization be cancelled.Students want them to stop suppressing the Marxist Society, and make a silent protest. The card reads "firmly against the reorganization of the Beijing University Marxist Society", "immediately rescind the reorganization decision", "32 reorganization’s members without a  Marxist Society member" and "want the workers’ and farmer’s Marxist Society ,not the bureaucratic Marxist Society." Within minutes, security guards tried to disperse and stop passers-by cell phones from taking photos. Soon, about 20 security guards arrived at the scene, and quickly surrounded the students, several security department’s leaders began to grab signs.

After the banners were taken away, the silent protest could no longer be carried out, and the Marxist Society students had to shout slogans: "protest against the reorganization of the Beijing University Marxist Society ", "return my fellow workers' home”, "work and study with innocence" and so on. At this time,the security guards surrounded them, elbows push, use kneecap to beat them, overwhelm the students. Several security department’s leaders, directly broke into the arm-in-arm students. Thirteen students were divided into two parts, Sun Jiayin, Wang Hanshu and Xue Ziwei were each put up arms and legs by several people,and carried into the building. At the same time, a classmate photographed ‘s cellphone was taken by four or five people. During the dispute, he was locked behind the throat, the coat pocket was torn, was once pushed to the ground, dragged into the building, only to escape a dozen minutes later.

Under the opposite press, the remained 10 students squatted to protect themselves. The SD guys immediately surrounded them to avoid pass-bys’ sight, and sometimes kicked the MS students by their shoes. Meanwhile the instructors, CYL and CPC’s officials from different schools and departments appeared, and pretended to kindheartedly ask the MS students for their demands. But after the students announced the demands, they performed as if being deaf, continued to ask for the demands. The students looked forward to communicating, but the instructors and officials just wasted students’ energy in the cold wind, and tried to cheat them to go into the Science Building No. 5 by saying “it’s cold outside”. Then the MS students demanded to meet Li Shishen，the vice secretary of CYL in PUK, and the vice-head of PUK Chen Baojian who had promised to solve the troubles, to solve the problem together.   

The instructors and officials repeatedly emphasized that the ground is cold and the students shouldn’t be frozen. But it is just the SD personnel who forced the students to squat and sit on the ground. Cheating was not working. Then the university staff started to force the students into the building. To pull a girl into the building, a female SD officials caught her feet, and took off her shoes. As a result, the girl’s feet had to be exposed in the cold wind with just a pair of thin socks. Several students lost their glasses and cellphones. When outside students asked the instructors and officials to release the students who were pulled into the building, the administration claimed: “They were waiting for you in the conference hall.”

After getting the promise of no violence from the university staff, the 10 students stood up. At once, they were squeezed by the security guards. And the SD officials also ordered more guards to oppress the students. In such conditions, the students had to sit down again to protect themselves.  

At this time, Chen Fujian appeared, and shouted abuse at the students. He orders the officials and guards to pull the students into the building. Under Chen’s order, 50s officials and guards started to caught the students’ hands and feet, and finally and violently pulled them into the Science Building No. 5. 

Lack of protection, some students’ heads seriously knocked against the wall. Student Xue Ziwei’s neck was twined by the wire of the guard’s interphone. What’s worse, Xue’s back of head directly knocked against the footstep of the building. Xue felt dizzy and demanded to send him to hospital. But the university staff refused. Some guards directly pulled the hat of a boy’s puffy jacket and nearly suffocated him. Some students’ puffy jackets were pulled into pieces.

Two female students’ trousers were nearly pulled off. A boy’s trousers were pulled off by force. And he was left on the ground with only pants. Another girl’s trousers and sweater were pull off, and her underwear was exposed. Some students’ cellphones, glasses and even wallets was lost or robbed.

From the very beginning, the university staff wanted to separate the 13 students. And finally, 2 students was respectively isolated in a classroom and a stairwell. The rest 11 students were hand in hand. And the guards and officials had to detain them together in social work lab 133. The officials from SD guarded outside the lab’s door to protect the detained students from opening it, and to isolate the students from other ones. But they refused to admit that it is an insult to personal freedom: “You want to talk with us. Then we give you a room to talk.” Some staff even abused the students: “You are the bastard of PKU! Son of bitch!”  

But in the next one hour, nobody come to talk and communicate with the isolated students. Only the SD officials and security guards were in the lab. So the MS students started to tell to the security guards why and how they helped and served workers, and advised the SD officials to give the security guard a rest.

At 17:00 p.m., the SD followed orders from upside, and installed the cell phone jammer outside the lab to cut off students’ connection with the outside and cover their atrocity. A SD personnel’s interphone received an order “They can’t use cellphone in the lab.” They tried to divide and controlled the detained students in this way. 

In this case, they developed a few solutions. At 20:00 pm,after students who need to go to toilet protested, three female students finally got a chance to go to the toilet together. However, after that, those three female students Zhang Ziyi, Zhang Xiaoyu and Sun Jiayan were brought to different classrooms by the  teachers forcely. Without cellphones as their communication tools, students being separated and monitored could only shout out through the closed windows. Securities who were patrolling around had already cleared the area, not allowing any students go through this area. It was even impossible to seek help from the windows, and those a dozen of students cannot even call the police. In this case, 8 male students remaining no longer had courage to go to toilet alone, they tried to finish their personal business in cups, being monitored. 

At 00:30 am, the university organized another force clearing, thirty or forty faculties got into the classroom.Even parents of Zhang Ziwei, who was one of the student activists there, were with them. They tried to bring Zhang Ziwei with force, using the excuse that Zhang needed to talk with his parents and those faculties alone. Since 8 students linked their arms together in order not to be separated, faculties specialized their works. Somebody would be in charge of pulling students’ arms, some others pulling their hoody hats, and some were using their legs to unbalance those students. Finally they carried Zhang into another room, and everyone else shared the same fate later.

As students who were there remembered, Wang Yiming, the Secretary of the communist youth league in Peking University, was abusing the students,”You cunts...I am not the secretary now. I need to keep my image dealing with others, not you! You have ruined my image!” Vice director of the Organizing Department Tian Dingfang was hitting student Wang Shiwei, saying “I am not from the Organizing Department!” After student Wang Shiwei was knocked down to ground, vice secretary of the party committee in the College of Chemistry Wang Fei kneeled down and said,” Why are you lying here?” “Guo Qi, vice secretary of the party committee in the College of Basic Medical Science, abused us as soon as he was there, saying we are inhumane, saying we are not human, we should not be qualified as students of PKU, not honesty, we have no principles, we are using resources of the university while doing things against the university, only thinking for ourselves, a group of scums...some words were so intense. After that every faculties there including staffs of student works, secretaries and vice secretaries of every college, staffs from the security department, secretary of the communist youth league in PKU Wang Yiming and Tian Dingfang from its organizing department abused us in turns, saying bad words. At last we even got bored in reacting with them, because there were too many of them.There words are so intense, like scums, garbages, inhumane and so on. It is hard to image words like that were said by PKU faculties, and not even once. At that time I feel my whole consciousness collapsed, It really broke my heart.”

As soon as students were separated, faculties from each colleges started retaliate those students in many different ridiculous ways.

Advisor and secretary of the communist youth league in the college of medicine Xu Guowang, talked with student activist Sun Jiayan for a few hours during the midnight, saying :”What could you get involving with the Marxism Society? They were not even letting you carry the slogan! Follow me and you will have a much better career, I could appoint you as the vice director of the communist youth league in our college. You have a few days to think about it, but you cannot refuse. I could publish your appointment without your agreement. I hope I could talk with you every two days from now on, maybe ten or thirty minutes each time.If you are not coming, I will go to your classroom or dorms(Xu the faculty is male, while Sun is female), I have no shame.” He even said,” I don’t only have the right to carry you back to PKU department of medical science, but also to carry you to my home!” Is there any difference between that words and sexual abuse? He also lied to her classmates in another room, saying Sun Jiayan had already agreed with his requirement, tring to separate the students with lies, making them surrender.

Every way the faculties tried had proved to be failed, of course, they thought about using the students’ parents to pressure them. Father of Zhang Ziwei hit him with five slaps, pulling his hats and hairs, tried to bring him home. Surrounding faculties applauded, saying “Kids who are not submitting deserve that！” Zhang Ziwei refused to go home, and his father had to ask Guo Qi to suspend his son’s schooling, who was the vice secretary of the party committee in the college of basic medical science. Guo agreed immediately ignoring Zhang Ziwei’s opposing. Mother of Zhang Ziwei was crying aside, tried to stop Guo and the father, but never worked. The family collapsed. 

Another student activist Zhang Xiaoyu’s parents, sister and brother in law came to Beijing at night. Her mother knocked her down, pulling her hair asking her stop getting involved with the Marxism Society. Also She kicked Zhang Xiaoyu’s shank countlessly, even made it swollen. The faculties pretend to be seeing nothing, instead they criticized Zhang Xiaoyu that she broke her parents’ heart.

During the whole time, vice president Chen Baojian never showed up. Many students stayed up almost the whole night, being occasionally asked for talk and education. Some sutdents only got no more that on hour sleep during the whole night. At that time, there were always staffs of student works and college faculties coming and pressuring students, saying their willing to punish the students, even the cops came and ask for recording, also abusing the students with words like “shameless” or “thugs”. Some students tried to reunite with others, but everytime they tried they would be blocked before the door and pull back to the room. Students were bruised and also weak due to the lack of sleep.

When all the ridiculousness ended, it was already 6:50 am in the next day.The staffs of student works were still wasting time on the last process. In order to leave together without anyone left behind, the students used all their words they could come up. However the staffs are still avoiding concrete issues, complaining that if they don’t go automatically, there would be passive effect against other students. Finally, with persistence all students reunite together, left Natural Science Building 5, the evil den in the PKU.


From December 28 to December 29, for those PKU students, they spent darkest 16 hours in their life.

Within the 16 hours, those faculties who were kind before lost all their kindness, using all the intense words against the students, even beating them, saying words like “heartless” and “scums”;Sometimes they tried to behave gently, serving water and food, tried to ingratiate the students, being totally different; sometimes they say “we just want to be promoted, trying to be awarded”, sometimes they say “I am for your goodness”;sometimes they tried to lure us with appointment in student union, or intimidate with future talks and meetings even in students private dorms...All of these together changed students’ mind on those faculty. It would not be strange that one of them said:”My whole consciousness collapsed, it really broke my heart.”

During 16 hours, those Chinese youth who believe in Marxism, was educated harshly in their own motherland. They were beaten, pulled, undressed, abused, intimidated and lured, even their own parents were slapping them on their face or kicking them under the faculties command!

Even though suffering a lot, these youth  still fighted together for 18 hours.  when they went  out the 5th science building , gaunt and clothes torn, they kept the firm will and decision to fight for the justice future.  They said, "The fighting between true Marxist Society and false has never stopped since the notice to reorganize the Marxist Society on December 27th. We will tell all the people that Peking University need the Marxist Society servicing workers But not Marxist Society in charged by bureaucracy."
