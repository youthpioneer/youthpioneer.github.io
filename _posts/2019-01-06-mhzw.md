title: 征文|为真正的马克思主义发出我们的声音
---

2019换新之际，就连马克思主义也在面临一场新老交替的斗争。一纸调令下，北京大学马克思主义学会被强制改组，在新的成员中，所有参加过原马会活动的人都被剔除在外了。

During the New Year Eve of 2019, even the ideology of Marxism is being replaced. With merely a signed paper, the Marxist Society of Peking University was reorganized by force, and all those once took part in the activity of the society were expelled. 

新改组的马会一改过去学习实践马克思主义的精神面貌，第一次公开活动就是组织学习儒家思想和宋明理学。随后又组织了参观改革开放展览的活动，只是没有时间去探索校内外工人们的未来出路。

The newly-reorganized "Marxist Society" abandoned the way of learning and practicing Marxism, whose first event was learning  Confucianism and feudal-China idealist philosophies. They also held the event of visiting the exhibition of "Reform and Opening", but they had too little time to discover the way of workers inside or outside the campus.

从团委的马会改组通知公示起，争论就没有停止过。原马会的同学们认为新马会丢掉了为工人们谋求幸福和尊严的初心，新马会的学生干部们则批评我们“没读几本马克思主义经典著作，一知半解就发表意见”，强调要“用经典涵养正气、淬炼思想、升华境界”。

Debates never died down after the publicity of the society reorganization. Students from the former society argued that the new Society had lost the purpose of striving for worker's happiness and dignisty; the cadres of new Society criticized that the students "read few chapters of Marxist classicals", and "express their wrong ideas without understanding it".

可是，这种争论往往没有结果，总是以一方被噤声暂告一段落。新马会的几篇文章，得到学工支持而被大力转发，篇篇都有几万甚至10万+的阅读量，而原马会的回应一经发出不过一小时、阅读量不过3千多，就要被屏蔽、封锁。很多人都来不及点开就看不到了，甚至直至今日，还有很多同学不清楚原马会同学们的主张，可见删帖之迅猛。

This stirred all those who believes Marxism or concerning about social reality, that what is True Marxism.

在这样信息不畅的情况下，争论的双方没有办法就具体问题一一辩论，只能不断地重申自己的立场。缺乏沟通，也难怪在一些朋友看来，我们都是在自顾自地喊话。

要想打破这种僵局，公开而自由的辩论是少不了的。


真理越辩越明。马克思主义只有和现实紧密结合时，才能真正展现批判性和实践性。在当今社会，马克思主义究竟如何体现，不在于谁的声音大，而在什么样的的解释最贴近现实、最能为劳动者的窘困生活指出改变的方向。

The truth is from the debates. The criticalness and practicalness of Marxism can only be achieved by combining closely with reality. How does Marxism present in modern days depends on not the volume of voice, but either can it explain the reality, and point out a way for workers now living in poverty and hardship.


如果说有人看到的现实片面，那么经过辩论可以让人更全面了解社会；如果说有人解读马克思主义出现了偏差，那么，有什么是一场辩论解决不了的呢？如果有，那就是两场。

If someone does have a one-sided view of reality, by debate can he recognize the world in a better way; if someone does have deviation in explaining Marxism, how could a debate not fixing that? If one debate can't achieve this, we can have one more.


我们期待王昱博、马宁等新马会的同学们，能和同学们进行一次全校范围内的辩论，让我们一同来探明马克思主义在当代中国的实践意义。这不光可以帮助我们扫除分歧，还能让对马克思主义感兴趣的同学们一同参与进来了解马克思主义，一举多得。

We hope that Wang Yubo, Ma Ning and all students from the new "Marxist Society" will accept a campus-wide debate with us on the practical meaning of Marxism in modern China. This can not only eliminate the differences in our opinions, but also allow more of the students to understand Marxism. We can achieve both at this stroke.

除此之外，我们每个人都可以为促成这种交流做出很多积极的影响。

In addition, all of us can contribute to this conversation.

我们希望朋友们可以把自己对于马克思主义的理解或者对新老马会的看法梳理成段落，不要有太多顾忌地公开发表出来，或者投稿给我们，我们将征求您的意见后发出。如果想说的话很多，不妨写成系统性的长篇文章，但哪怕只有一句两句话也是在空旷的空间里发出了自己的声音。

We hope our friends can have some comments on their view of Marxism and the two Marxist societies, you can either publish it or subscribe it to us, whom will put it out with your approvement. It is good if you have a lot to say, but it is also a voice heard with only some words.

参加讨论的人越多，辩论的氛围就越热烈。我们也相信“什么是真正的马克思主义”这个问题，也会随着大家的不断探讨而越来越明晰的。

We believe that, with more and more individuals in discussion, and with more and more heated debates and arguements, we will have a much more view on the true idea of Marxism.
