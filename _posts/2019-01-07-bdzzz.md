展振振，男，21岁，1997年7月28日生。

初中就读于周口市郸城县光明中学，

高中就读于郸城一高，

北京大学生命科学学院2015级本科生。

Zhan Zhenzhen, male, 21 years old, born July 28, 1997,Junior high school enrolled in Guangming Middle School, Yucheng County, Zhoukou City,High school enrolled in The First High School of Dancheng,Grade 2015 undergraduate, School of Life Sciences, Peking University

因为家境贫寒，振振最懂得工人的苦楚。上大学以来，展振振长期参与和组织北大马会工友之家的活动，和工友们一起跑步、打球锻炼、跳广场舞、外出游玩，与工友谈心交朋友，举办的活动已然成为工友生活的一部分。他主持筹办的2018年元旦晚会，虽然仍是在地下车库，但场面热闹非凡，受到工友们的一致好评。

Because of his poor family, Zhenzhen knows the sufferings of workers best. Since he went to university, Zhan Zhenzhen has participated in and organized the activities of the Workers' Home of the Marxist Society of Peking University for a long time. He has been running, playing sports, dancing in the square, going out to play, and making friends with the workers. The events in which he was involved have become part of the lives of the workers. He hosted the 2018 New Year's party – although still in the underground garage, but the scene was very lively – highly praised by the workers.

在他和工友们交心娱乐相处期间，互相吐露心声期间，他发现工友的处境与想象之中的相差甚远，甚至于用工方大量地违规违法，工友身心受到压抑。2015年末北大的一份后勤工人调研报告，至今将近三年，但他仍看到工友的处境竟无实质上的改善，心生悲痛。怀着对工友的浓浓热情与对违法违规现象的不满，他决定发起又一次的后勤工友访谈。

During his time of communicating with the workers, he found that the situation of workers was far from what was imagined - the abundant violations of laws and regulations by employers, and the physical and mental depression of workers. At the end of 2015, Peking University had a investigation report on logistics workers. It has been nearly three years since then, but he has yet to see a substantial improvement in the situation of workers. Sorrowful, he decided to initiate another investigation on the logistic workers, with a keen enthusiasm for the workers and dissatisfaction with the illegal violations.

2018年5月1日，历时半年的调研报告终于发出。但新生的将近两万字的调研报告在几个小时之内就迎来被删帖的命运。振振无奈之下向王仰麟校长的校长信箱内递交了自己的一封信，写出自己期待后勤工友条件能有所改善的恳切心意，努力之下，终于得到了举办座谈会的承诺。为了这场座谈会，振振积极拉群，联系同学做现场的学生代表，带领大家一起整理我们的诉求，在座谈会上提出很多建设性的建议，座谈会后整理材料，和一个个中心做细致的对接……

On May 1, 2018, a investigation report that costs half a year was finally published. However, the new investigation report of nearly 20,000 words ushered in the fate of being deleted within a few hours. Zhenzhen had no choice but to send a letter to the mailbox of President Wang Yanglin, writing his sincere intention to look forward to the improvement of the conditions of the logistics workers. With his efforts, he finally got the promise of a symposium. For this symposium, Zhenzhen actively set up chatting groups, contacted students to be representatives, led everyone to sort out our demands, put forward a lot of constructive suggestions at the symposium, sorted out the materials after the symposium, contacted every department concerned...


点点滴滴中，振振只是希望调研报告中的种种问题能够有所改善。同时，为了能够让在校园里隐形的工友们能够回到我们的视线之中。他继续运营起了自己的公众号——为了他们的微笑。“为了他们的微笑”刊登与校内工友的点滴日常，座谈会的经过，经保卫处申请的与保安小哥们的第一次打球活动，被侵权工友的维权经过直播，发起燕园工友最美的活动，向同学们展现了校园工友的喜怒哀乐。

In every little bit, Zhenzhen only hope that the problems in the investigation report can be improved. At the same time, in order to let the invisible workers in the campus to return to our sights, he continued to operate his own Wechat public accout - For Their Smile. "For Their Smile" published the daily work of the campus workers, the symposium, the first basketball game with the security guards applied through the Security Department, the rights protection of the infringed workers through online streaming, and the activity of "The most beautiful worker in the PKU campus" was launched, to show the students the joys and sorrows of the campus workers.

在校园工友的维权事件中，他始终行动在第一线，第一个去积极联络工友，第一个去提供支持与帮助。从举牌静站抗议，发传单到最后的谈判，展振振对工友一陪到底，不曾放弃。

In the campus workers' rights protection incident, he always acted on the front line. He is the first to actively contact the workers, the first to provide support and help. From standing protest, handing out leaflets to the final negotiation, Zhenzhen stayed with the workers until the end and never gave up.

12月25日，振振前往韶山参与全国的纪念毛主席活动，并且自述是如何从一个贫苦出身的孩子成长为一个愿意为工人服务的青年。不幸却发生了：1月2日，因为参加纪念毛主席的活动，振振在长沙被捕，自此音讯全无。紧接着，学校就对振振做出了退学处理的决定，并在1月7日上午正式生效。这意味着，关心、服务工友的振振，坚定践行信仰的振振，在因纪念活动而失去自由之后，被母校北大开除了！

On December 25, Zhenzhen went to Shaoshan to participate in the national commemoration of Chairman Mao, and self-described how he grew up from a poor child to a young man willing to serve the workers. Unfortunately, it happened: on January 2, Zhenzhen was arrested in Changsha for attending the commemoration, since then there is no news. Subsequently, the university made a decision on the order to quit of Zhenzhen, which took effect in the morning of January 7. This means that after losing freedom due to the commemorative activity, Zhenzhen, who cares and serves the workers, who firmly practices his faith, was expelled from his alma mater, Peking University!

一位保洁大姐提起振振来，笑着这样说，“只要有振振参与组织的活动，永远都办的最好，这孩子总能活跃气氛，总能照顾好每一个人。”现在振振被捕和被开除了，工友们该多么思念、多么揪心啊！他所捍卫的美好信念，就这样被残酷地扼死了。可是，我们实在不能容忍这样的事情啊，难道我们要承认，现实唯一的道路就只有功利主义吗？

A cleaning elder sister mentioned Zhenzhen, and said with a smile, "As long as Zhenzhen involved in the organization of activities, he will always do the best. This young man will always be active and take good care of everyone." Now Zhenzhen has been arrested and expelled, how much his fellows should miss and worry! The good faith he defended was cruelly killed. However, we really cannot tolerate such things. Do we have to admit that the only way of reality is utilitarianism?

希望大家能帮忙转发、扩散，让更多人关注，给予寒风中的青年以温暖的慰藉和支持，感谢大家！

I hope that everyone can help forward, spread; let more people pay attention; give young people in the cold wind with warm comfort and support. Thank you!
