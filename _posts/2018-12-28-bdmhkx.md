2018年12月28日下午下午14:10左右，北京大学马克思主义学会同学在北京大学东南门附近的理科五号楼门前静站抗议，牌子上写着“坚决抗议改组、立即撤销不合理改组决定、32名改组人无一马会会员”字样。在马会会长邱占萱凌晨一点被约谈、绑架之后，27日晚北大校方在校内论坛上发布公告，称北京大学马克思主义学会违反相关规定，强制改组，并列出32名改组成员。成员为中共党员等，无一人是北大马会原会员。北大马会同学对这一空降强制改组非常不满，今早即发表声明抗议改组，并有数十人联名；同学前去反应诉求，却遭到强硬拒绝。

马会同学开始静站举牌后，保卫处出动十余名保安警力，驱散路人并禁止拍照。马会同学转过身继续静站举牌。保卫处人员开始遮盖围观路人手机摄像头。几分钟后，二十余名保卫部人员和学工老师强行冲散马会同学。同学们手挽手围在一起，被保卫处保安强行拉散殴打，有的同学甚至被拉翻在地，手指磨出血、眼镜被打坏，同学们被拉入旁边的理科五号楼，包括正在拍照的同学。旁观群众被保卫处一一驱散。

北大马会同学被拉入楼内后依然想要冲出教学楼，抗议校园暴力和对人身自由的侵犯，一名拍照的同学一直被保卫处人员拖拽拉扯、一名女生被强行按在墙上。经过顽抗，部分马会同学得以脱身，在五号楼门口向路人控诉近来北大马会的遭遇，高呼“还我北大马会、还我工友之家、反对校园暴力抗议改组马会、撤销马会改组”。有的同学被摁倒在地，抢夺手机。警察、保安、学工老师以及不明身份人员近五十人围堵在同学面前，企图把学生拆散。同学们坚持喊口号，团团坐在地上，背靠背。

15:15分左右，三名同学被非法拘禁在会议室，限制人身自由并被抢夺手机。一名同学被反扣双手将要送到房间里关起来。据悉，近20余名保安围堵围攻学生。 

15:34分左右，保卫处开始对同学进行清场。

15:40分左右，通讯软件上传出吵闹声，目前同学们出现短暂失联。

16:40分，通讯软件传出消息，同学们理科五号楼的一间教室里，三四个人架着一个人拖进来，好多同学的眼睛和鞋被扯掉了，衣服被撕烂了，甚至有女同学的衣服被掀起来，裤子被差点扯掉。

现在同学们在教室里手挽着手，给保安小哥揭露后勤和保卫部、文安公司的违法行为和同学们办工友之家的初衷。几个领导已经不知去向。
